Mediceon Needle Guide – Phase 4 Prototype
This repository documents the latest development stage of a low-cost, open-source needle guidance system designed for CT-assisted medical procedures. The project focuses on improving precision in needle targeting during biopsies, ablations, and drug delivery, especially in under-resourced clinical environments. The current design is fully mechanical, requires no electronics, and supports 3D printing using medical-grade PETG and silicone.

The final prototype offers three degrees of control—slice, tilt, and depth—via a spherical-coordinate-inspired structure. Each axis is mechanically restricted to improve targeting consistency and reduce user error. A custom-molded silicone base provides anatomical conformity, while integrated levels ensure proper alignment with the patient’s skin.
